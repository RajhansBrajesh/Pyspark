use snake_case over camleCase in system like Python and SQL

Liquid Clustering: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta/clustering
-- Alter an existing table
ALTER TABLE <table_name>
CLUSTER BY (<clustering_columns>)
Liquid cluster has advantage over Zordering that if keys changes it can optimize the table without reingesting the data.

# optimize/compating/z-order
def optimize():
 max_hist_timestamp = spark.sql("select datediff(current_timestamp(), max(timestamp)) as diff from (describe history silver_table) where operation = 'optimize'").collect()[0][0]
 spark.sql(f" optimize silver_table zorder by (pk1,pk2)")
